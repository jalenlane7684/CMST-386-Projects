            <h2>How Do They Work?</h2>
            <p>The inner workings of a search engine can be split up into three parts: crawling, indexing, and providing results and ranking those results. Crawling is the process of a search engine sending out bots called "crawlers" that discover new content on the web. "Indexing" is placing this newly discovered content into an organized database. This database is used to find information relevant to the search. After relevant search results are found, they are ranked by relevance and popularity.</p>

            <h2>Keywords and Descriptions</h2>
            <p>Keywords and descriptions are crucial in making your website discoverable to the target audience. Keywords will help your website be discovered when a user types in a specific word. For example, if you have a wallpaper website, "wallpaper" would be a great keyword.</p>

            <p>A good description makes your website more appealing to users that are browsing the web. Keep the description short, but descriptive enough so that the user knows that your website has the information they need.</p>

            <h2>Writing Relevent Content Links</h2>
            <p>In order to write good content links, you should have four goals in mind: anchor text, how descriptive the anchor text is, and whether your link is internal to your website or external. Your link should always have anchor text, and the text should be relevant to the content within your website. Each page in your website should link to at least one other page on the website, and whenever you link to other websites, use nofollow if you do not trust the destination.</p>

            <h2>Good Heading Hierarchy</h2>
            <p>Having good heading hierarchy gives your website a clear structure and significantly improves its readability. When using heading tags, you should start with the h1 tag for your overall title of the website. For other sections after that, use h2 through h6. You should go down a number for each subheading. For example, if you have a subsection under an h2 heading, use an h3 heading for it. Additionally, when using headings, keep the style consistent across all headings.</p>
