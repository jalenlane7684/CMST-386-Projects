      <h2>Why is Responsive Design Important?</h2>
      <p>Responsive design is important because it ensures that the content on your website is adapted to all device sizes. This means that users that may only have access to a phone, tablet, or computer will be able to read the content on your website. This in turn will increase the amount of traffic that comes to your website.</p>

      <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
      <p>Google Analytics is an amazing tool that can give you information about the users that access your website. </p>
      <h3>Realtime Reports</h3>
      <p>Realtime reporting tells you what is happening on your site in realtime. </p>
      <h3>Acquisition Reports</h3>
      <p>Aquisition reports determine <em>how</em> your users reach your site. There are two types of acquisition reports: user acquisition and traffic acquisition. User acquisition shows how users reach your site, and traffic acquisition shows an overview of website traffic and engagement.</p>
      <h3>Engagement Reports</h3>
      <p>Engagement reports help you determine what your users interact witih the most in order to improve overall engagement. An event report tells you actions taken by users as well as any system events or errors that occur. Page and screen reports tell you what parts of your site your users engage with the most. Conversion reports will show your conversions through marketing channels.</p>
