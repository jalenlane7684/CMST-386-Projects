            <h2>LESS Featurees</h2>
            <h3>Mixins</h3>
            <p>LESS allows you to "mix in" css properties from existing classes and ids. To "mix in" an existing style to a new selector, type the class name or id name followed by parenthesis. <br> <em>Examples: .class-name();, #id-name();s</em></p>
            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables, like in other programming languages, allow you to store values. In LESS, they can be used to store colors, selector names, urls, and values. Variables do not have to be declared before they are used.</p>
            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p>Functions can be used to perform calculations and change values. There are several prebuilt functions in LESS</p>
            <h3>Operators</h3>
            <p>Operators can be used to perform calculations as well as add logic to your stylesheet. There are the standard arithmetic operators as well as comparison or logical operators. </p>
            <h3>Nested Variables</h3>
            <p>Nested variables are an excellent way to organize variables within your stylesheet. For example, if you have a specific theme, you can nest all of the variables within that theme into one object. Nested variables can be accessed using dot notation.</p>
